# Complete Course Audit: 8-Week AI Red Team Transition
**Ensuring Every Activity Directly Prepares Students for Professional AI Security Work**

---

## Course-Wide Philosophy

**Core Principle**: Every single activity, exercise, code sample, and deliverable must have a direct, demonstrable connection to real-world AI red team engagements.

**Non-Negotiables**:
1. Each week builds directly on previous weeks
2. All code/models created are used as attack targets in later weeks
3. Every concept maps to an industry-standard framework or methodology
4. Deliverables become portfolio pieces for job applications

---

## Week-by-Week Red Team Relevance Audit

### Week 1: ML Foundations **CRITICAL PATH**
**Connection to AI Red Team Work:**
- Build models that become attack targets in Weeks 3-4
- Establish baseline metrics for measuring attack success
- Map OWASP ML Top 10 to familiar web security patterns
- Create model API that will be tested in adversarial attacks

**What Students Should Say After Week 1:**
*"I built a model I can now learn to attack. I understand how OWASP maps to AI security. I can query and document model behavior for penetration testing."*

**Skills Transfer Assessment:**
- Traditional pentester skill → AI red team skill
- Network scanning → Model fingerprinting
- Service enumeration → Architecture extraction
- Vulnerability scanning → Adversarial testing

---

### Week 2: Core AI Adversarial Concepts - **NEEDS STRENGTHENING**
**Current Issues:**
- Membership inference exercise lacks clear connection to real-world exploitation
- Paper summaries too academic, not actionable
- Lifecycle mapping needs more concrete examples

**Red Team Improvement Plan:**

**Objective 1: Membership Inference → Data Leakage Detection**
- **Real Scenario**: Client ML model in production - need to detect if it's leaking training data
- **Exercises**: Query model to extract information about training data membership
- **Deliverable**: Vulnerability report showing data leakage risk

**Objective 2: AI Pentest Lifecycle → Methodology Transfer**
- **Expand**: Create side-by-side comparison of traditional pentest vs AI pentest phases
- **Add**: Specific tool mappings (Nmap → Model fingerprinting tools, Burp → Adversarial testing frameworks)
- **Deliverable**: AI pentest methodology document you'd use on engagements

**Objective 3: Paper Analysis → Research Application**
- **Change**: Instead of just summarizing papers, students extract attack techniques
- **Add**: Implement one technique from the paper as a working exploit
- **Deliverable**: Notebook showing paper technique applied to Week 1's model

**Improvements Needed**:
```
OLD: "Summarize 3 papers on poisoning/inference"
NEW: "Extract 3 attack techniques from papers, implement one, test on Week 1 model, 
      write vulnerability finding report"
```

---

### Week 3: Evasion & Inference Attacks **STRONG**
**Connection to AI Red Team Work:**
- Uses Week 1 model as attack target (clear progression)
- FGSM/PGD are industry-standard evasion attacks
- Membership inference directly applicable to client engagements
- Vulnerability report mimics real pentest deliverables

**Real-World Application:**
- **Scenario**: Client has ML model in production API
- **Week 3 Skills Applied**: Craft adversarial samples to fool the model
- **Business Impact**: Demonstrate that attacker can bypass fraud detection / spam filter / malware detection

**Minor Enhancement Needed:**
- Add comparative analysis: Which attacks work best on which model types?
- Add automation: How to scale attacks for large-scale testing?

---

### Week 4: Poisoning & Backdoors **STRONG**
**Connection to AI Red Team Work:**
- Poisoning attacks mirror supply chain attacks in traditional security
- Backdoors applicable to insider threat scenarios
- Defense evaluation prepares for remediation recommendations

**Real-World Application:**
- **Scenario**: Client uses third-party training data (S3 bucket, external vendor)
- **Week 4 Skills Applied**: Demonstrate how poisoned data compromises model
- **Business Impact**: Show supply chain vulnerability, recommend data validation controls

**Enhancement Opportunity:**
- Add cloud-specific scenarios (S3 data poisoning, training pipeline compromise)
- Connect to compliance frameworks (SOC 2 controls for ML training data)

---

### Week 5: Generative AI Vulnerabilities - **NEEDS STRENGTHENING**
**Current Issues:**
- Jailbreak prompts feel like "hacking demos" not professional red team work
- Garak scanning lacks context on when/why you'd use it on engagements
- Missing connection to production LLM deployments

**Red Team Improvement Plan:**

**Objective 1: LLM Security Assessment Methodology**
- **Expand**: Create systematic approach to LLM security testing
- **Add**: Scenarios: Customer service chatbot, code generation API, document summarization
- **Deliverable**: Testing methodology document for LLM engagements

**Objective 2: Jailbreak Prompts → Vulnerability Discovery**
- **Change**: Don't just craft prompts - categorize and analyze success rates
- **Add**: Business impact assessment (when would this matter in production?)
- **Deliverable**: Vulnerability findings report (like Week 3)

**Objective 3: Garak Integration → Automated Testing**
- **Expand**: Custom probe development for client-specific scenarios
- **Add**: Integration with testing pipeline (not just standalone scanning)
- **Deliverable**: Custom probe library for LLM security testing

**Improvements Needed**:
```
OLD: "Craft 10 jailbreak prompts"
NEW: "Systematically test client LLM endpoint with categorized jailbreak attempts,
      document success rates, provide risk assessment, recommend mitigations"
```

---

### Week 6: Advanced LLM Red Teaming - **NEEDS REFOCUSING**
**Current Issues:**
- Purple Llama exercise feels disconnected from real engagements
- "Email to data scientist" exercise lacks professional context
- Chained attacks not clearly tied to exploitation scenarios

**Red Team Improvement Plan:**

**Objective 1: End-to-End LLM Attack Chain**
- **Change**: Build complete attack scenario from reconnaissance to exploitation
- **Add**: Example: Social engineering attack using LLM (phishing, impersonation)
- **Deliverable**: Full attack chain documentation

**Objective 2: Purple Llama → Benchmarking for Clients**
- **Reframe**: Purple Llama as vulnerability benchmarking tool
- **Add**: Use results to create client security posture assessment

## High-Priority Improvements

### Priority 1: Strengthen Week 2 Academic Content
**Current Issue**: Paper summaries too theoretical
**Solution**: Make research actionable
```
Before: "Summarize 3 papers"
After: "Extract attack technique from paper → Implement technique → 
       Test on Week 1 model → Document as vulnerability finding"
```

### Priority 2: Make Week 5 LLM Exercises More Professional
**Current Issue**: Jailbreak prompts feel like demos, not red team work
**Solution**: Frame as systematic security assessment
```
Before: "Craft jailbreak prompts"
After: "Systematic LLM security assessment → Categorize attack vectors →
       Measure success rates → Document findings → Recommend controls"
```

### Priority 3: Connect Week 6 to Real Scenarios
**Current Issue**: Purple Llama and chained attacks lack context
**Solution**: Build complete attack scenarios
```
Before: "Run benchmarks, chain attacks"
After: "Real-world scenario: Test client's customer service chatbot →
       Build complete attack chain → Measure business impact →
       Provide remediation strategy"
```

## Validation Checklist

Every week should answer:
- [ ] **Why is this relevant to AI red team work?**
- [ ] **What real-world scenario does this prepare students for?**
- [ ] **How does this build on previous weeks?**
- [ ] **What deliverable can go in their portfolio?**
- [ ] **How would students use this on a real engagement?**

## Success Metrics

Students should be able to articulate by Week 8:
1. "I can scope an AI security engagement using OWASP ML Top 10"
2. "I can systematically test ML models for adversarial vulnerabilities"
3. "I can assess LLM security using industry-standard methodologies"
4. "I can write professional vulnerability reports that drive remediation"
5. "I have a portfolio demonstrating complete AI pentest workflow"

**If students can't say these things, the course needs adjustment.**
