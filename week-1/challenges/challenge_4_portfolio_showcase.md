# Challenge 4: Portfolio Milestone - Week 1 Showcase

**Time Estimate**: 30 minutes  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Deliverable**: Portfolio update with Week 1 section

## Objective

Create your first portfolio entry documenting Week 1 accomplishments. This establishes the habit of documenting work and building a professional portfolio throughout the course.

## Why Portfolio Matters

In red teaming, your portfolio demonstrates:
- Technical capability
- Professional presentation skills
- Real-world application of knowledge
- Communication ability

Clients and employers want to see:
- What you can do
- How you present findings
- Quality of your work

## Your Task

Create a portfolio entry for Week 1 that includes:

### 1. Week 1 Summary (10 min)

Write a brief summary (3-4 paragraphs) of what you accomplished:
- What you learned about ML foundations
- Key skills developed
- Projects completed

### 2. Visual Evidence (10 min)

Include screenshots or outputs:
- Trained MNIST model metrics (>95% accuracy)
- Baseline model behavior analysis
- Attack surface map (from Challenge 2)
- Any interesting visualizations

### 3. Key Deliverables (5 min)

List and link to your Week 1 deliverables:
- Exercise solutions
- Challenge outputs
- Case study analysis
- Documentation created

### 4. Skills Highlight (5 min)

List skills demonstrated:
- Model training with PyTorch
- Model querying and analysis
- Attack surface mapping
- Real-world incident analysis

## Portfolio Structure

Create or update `portfolio/week-1-showcase.md`:

# Week 1: ML Foundations for AI Red Teamers

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of week]

## Accomplishments

### Technical Skills Developed
- [List key technical skills]

### Projects Completed
1. **MNIST Classifier Training**
   - Achieved [X]% accuracy
   - Learned: [Key learning]
   - [Screenshot/evidence]

2. **Model Querying and Analysis**
   - Analyzed baseline model behavior
   - Extracted confidence scores
   - [Screenshot/evidence]

3. **Attack Surface Mapping**
   - Created comprehensive ML pipeline attack surface map
   - Identified [X] attack vectors
   - [Link to map]

4. **Real-World Case Study**
   - Analyzed adversarial patch attack incident
   - Mapped to OWASP ML Top 10
   - [Link to analysis]

## Key Learnings

### Technical Insights
- [What technical concepts did you grasp?]

### Red Team Application
- [How does this apply to AI red teaming?]

### Future Application
- [How will you use this in future weeks?]

## Visual Evidence

### Model Training Results

## Deliverables

- [Link to exercise 1]
- [Link to exercise 2]
- [Link to challenge outputs]
- [Link to case study]

## Skills Demonstrated

- ✅ PyTorch model training
- ✅ Model inference and querying
- ✅ Attack surface analysis
- ✅ Real-world incident analysis
- ✅ OWASP ML Top 10 mapping

## Next Steps

Week 2 focus: Membership inference attacks and attack taxonomy
```

## Portfolio Best Practices

**Do:**
- Include visual evidence (screenshots, diagrams)
- Write clear, professional descriptions
- Link to actual deliverables
- Highlight skills relevant to red teaming
- Keep it concise but comprehensive

**Don't:**
- Include sensitive information
- Copy code without attribution
- Exaggerate accomplishments
- Skip visual evidence

## Portfolio Organization Options

**Option 1: Single Markdown File**
- `portfolio/README.md` with sections for each week
- Simple, easy to maintain

**Option 2: Weekly Files**
- `portfolio/week-1.md`, `portfolio/week-2.md`, etc.
- Better organization, easier to navigate

**Option 3: GitHub Pages Website**
- Most professional presentation
- Best for final portfolio (Week 8)

For now, use Option 1 or 2. We'll enhance in Week 8.

## Success Criteria

Your Week 1 portfolio entry should:
- Be professionally written
- Include visual evidence
- List clear accomplishments
- Demonstrate skills relevant to AI red teaming
- Be ready to show to potential clients/employers

## Next Steps

- Continue building portfolio each week
- Week 3: Add attack demonstrations
- Week 5: Add LLM security work
- Week 7: Add professional reports
- Week 8: Curate final portfolio

## Notes

This is the first of 5 portfolio milestones:
- ✅ Week 1: Foundation showcase
- Week 3: Attack demonstration
- Week 5: LLM security portfolio
- Week 7: Complete report portfolio
- Week 8: Final curated portfolio
