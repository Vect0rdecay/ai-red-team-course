# Challenge 4: Paper Reading & Implementation Challenge

**Time Estimate**: 3 hours  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Deliverable**: `week-2/paper_presentation.md` + implementation code

## Objective

Read an AI security research paper, extract the key technique, implement it, and create a presentation. This builds research-to-practice translation skills essential for staying current in AI security.

## Why This Matters

AI security moves fast. New attack techniques are published monthly. As a red teamer, you need to:
- Read and understand research papers
- Extract implementable techniques
- Apply techniques to real targets
- Stay ahead of defenses

This challenge develops those skills.

**Deliverable**: Technique summary

### Phase 3: Implementation (90 min)

**Task**: Implement the key technique

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Set up test environment (Week 1 model)
2. Implement core algorithm
3. Test on your model
4. Measure results
5. Compare to paper results (if possible)

**Code Requirements**:
- Clean, commented code
- Reproducible (include random seeds)
- Documented (what it does, how to use)
- Tested (works on your model)

**Deliverable**: Working implementation + test results

### Phase 4: Presentation Creation (15 min)

**Task**: Create 5-slide presentation

**Slide Structure**:
1. **Problem**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Method**: How does the technique work? (High-level)
3. **Implementation**: What did you implement?
4. **Results**: What did you achieve?
5. **Application**: How would you use this in red teaming?

**Format**: Markdown slides or simple PDF
