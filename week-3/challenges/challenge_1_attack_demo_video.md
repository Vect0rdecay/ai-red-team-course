# Challenge 1: Adversarial Attack Demo Video

**Time Estimate**: 1.5 hours  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Deliverable**: `week-3/attack_demo_video.mp4` (2-3 minutes)

## Objective

Create a short video demonstrating an adversarial attack. This builds technical communication skills essential for explaining complex attacks to clients, stakeholders, and non-technical audiences.

## Why This Matters

Red teamers need to:
- Explain technical attacks simply
- Demonstrate impact visually
- Communicate findings effectively
- Create compelling evidence

Video demonstrations are powerful tools for:
- Client presentations
- Executive briefings
- Training materials
- Portfolio showcases

## Video Structure

Your 2-3 minute video should cover:

### Introduction (15-20 seconds)
- What attack are you demonstrating?
- Why does it matter?

### Demonstration (60-90 seconds)
- Show original image and prediction
- Show adversarial image (looks similar)
- Show model being fooled
- Highlight the perturbation (if visible)

### Explanation (30-40 seconds)
- How did the attack work? (High-level)
- What's the business impact?
- Why should clients care?

### Conclusion (10-15 seconds)
- Key takeaway
- Call to action (if appropriate)

## Production Steps

### Step 1: Script Writing (20 min)

**Task**: Write a clear, simple script

**Script Template**:
```
[Scene 1: Introduction]
"This is a demonstration of an adversarial attack on an image classifier. 
We'll show how a small, imperceptible change can fool an AI model."

[Scene 2: Original Image]
"Here's an original image of a [digit/object]. 
The model correctly identifies it as [class] with 95% confidence."

[Scene 3: Attack Creation]
"We'll add a carefully crafted perturbation..."

[Scene 4: Adversarial Image]
"The adversarial image looks identical to the human eye. 
But the model now predicts [wrong class] with 90% confidence."

[Scene 5: Explanation]
"This attack works by exploiting the model's decision boundary. 
In a real fraud detection system, this could bypass security controls."

[Scene 6: Conclusion]
"Adversarial attacks are a real threat that organizations need to test for."
```

**Tips**:
- Use simple language
- Avoid jargon when possible
- Explain impact, not just technique
- Keep it conversational

### Step 2: Preparation (20 min)

**Task**: Prepare your demo materials

**What You Need**:
1. Clean test image
2. Adversarial version of same image
3. Model predictions for both
4. Perturbation visualization (optional)
5. Screen recording software

**Tools**:
- Screen recorder: OBS Studio (free), QuickTime (Mac), or built-in recorder
- Visualization: matplotlib, your attack code
- Editing: Basic editor (optional, but helpful)

### Step 3: Recording (30 min)

**Task**: Record your demonstration

**Recording Tips**:
- Practice once before recording
- Speak clearly and slowly
- Pause between sections
- Show mouse cursor moving (helps audience follow)
- Zoom in on important parts
- Use annotations (arrows, highlights) if helpful

**Technical Setup**:
- Record at 1080p if possible
- Good audio quality (use microphone if available)
- Clean desktop (no personal info visible)
- Test recording first (10 seconds, check quality)

### Step 4: Editing (20 min)

**Task**: Polish your video (optional but recommended)

**Basic Edits**:
- Cut mistakes/pauses
- Add title slide (optional)
- Add text annotations if needed
- Ensure audio is clear

**Advanced (Optional)**:
- Add transitions
- Include background music (keep it subtle)
- Add logo/branding
- Create thumbnail

### Step 5: Export & Review (10 min)

**Task**: Export final video and review

**Export Settings**:
- Format: MP4 (widely compatible)
- Resolution: 1080p or 720p
- Keep file size reasonable (<50MB for 3 min)

**Review Checklist**:
- Clear audio
- Visuals are readable
- Explanation is understandable
- Fits time limit (2-3 minutes)
- No sensitive information

## Deliverable Structure

### Video File
- File: `week-3/attack_demo_video.mp4`
- Length: 2-3 minutes
- Quality: Clear audio and video

### Supporting Documentation (Optional)
Create `week-3/video_script.md`:
- Your script
- Key points covered
- Links to resources shown

## Success Criteria

Your video should:
- Be 2-3 minutes long
- Clearly demonstrate the attack
- Explain concepts simply
- Show before/after clearly
- Be professional quality
- Have clear audio

## Real-World Application

Use this video for:
- Client presentations
- Executive briefings
- Training sessions
- Portfolio showcase
- Conference talks
- Social media (if appropriate)

## Tips for Success

**Script**:
- Practice reading aloud
- Time yourself
- Simplify technical terms
- Focus on impact over mechanics

**Recording**:
- Record in quiet environment
- Good lighting if showing yourself
- Test equipment first
- Multiple takes are okay

**Content**:
- Show, don't just tell
- Visual demonstrations > explanations
- Use examples audience can relate to
- End with clear takeaway

## Extension Ideas

- Create multiple videos (different attacks)
- Make a series (one per attack type)
- Add captions/subtitles
- Create different versions (technical vs executive)
- Upload to portfolio/Vimeo/YouTube (if appropriate)

## Portfolio Note

This video demonstrates:
- Technical communication skills
- Ability to explain complex topics simply
- Professional presentation ability
- Real-world application understanding

## Next Steps

- Practice presenting findings verbally
- Use video in Week 7 client presentation
- Create additional videos for other attacks
- Build video library for portfolio
