# Challenge 2: Attack Library Comparison Matrix

**Time Estimate**: 1 hour  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Deliverable**: `week-3/tool_comparison_matrix.md`

## Objective

Compare attack libraries (ART, CleverHans, Foolbox) by testing the same attack across all three. This builds tool selection skills for real engagements.

## Why This Matters

In real engagements, you need to:
- Choose the right tool for the job
- Understand tool strengths and weaknesses
- Make efficient tool selection decisions
- Justify tool choices to clients

Different tools have different:
- Ease of use
- Attack success rates
- Performance (speed)
- Documentation quality
- Community support

## The Comparison

Test the same attack (FGSM/FGM) using:
1. ART (Adversarial Robustness Toolbox)
2. CleverHans
3. Foolbox

Compare across multiple dimensions.

## Comparison Dimensions

### 1. Ease of Use
- How easy is installation?
- How intuitive is the API?
- How much code needed?
- Documentation quality?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (5 = easiest)

### 2. Attack Success Rate
- What accuracy does attack achieve?
- How consistent are results?
- Does it match expected performance?

**Metric**: Actual attack success rate on your model

### 3. Performance (Speed)
- How fast does attack execute?
- Time per sample
- Scalability for large batches

**Metric**: Time to generate 100 adversarial samples

### 4. Documentation
- Is documentation clear?
- Are examples helpful?
- Is API well-documented?
- Community resources available?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (5 = best documentation)

### 5. Flexibility
- Can you customize attacks?
- Are advanced features available?
- Can you chain attacks?
- Integration with other tools?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (5 = most flexible)

### 6. Community & Support
- Active community?
- Recent updates?
- GitHub stars/activity?
- Stack Overflow presence?

**Rating Scale**: 1-5 (5 = best support)

## Your Task

### Step 1: Test Same Attack (30 min)

Run FGSM/FGM attack on your Week 1 model using all three libraries:

**ART Test**:
```python
# Use your exercise_1_art_evasion_attacks.py
# Measure: Attack success rate, time
```

**CleverHans Test**:
```python
# Use your exercise_2_cleverhans_evasion_attacks.py
# Measure: Attack success rate, time
```

**Foolbox Test**:
```python
# Use your exercise_3_foolbox_evasion_attacks.py
# Measure: Attack success rate, time
```

**Metrics to Record**:
- Attack success rate (%)
- Time to generate 100 samples (seconds)
- Memory usage (optional)
- Code complexity (lines of code)

### Step 2: Rate Each Dimension (15 min)

For each tool, rate each dimension (1-5 scale) and document why.

### Step 3: Create Comparison Matrix (15 min)

Create visual comparison table and summary.
