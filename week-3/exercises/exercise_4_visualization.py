Week 3 - Exercise 4: Advanced Visualization for Attack Results

Objective: Create publication-quality visualizations for adversarial attacks

Red Team Context: Visualizations are crucial for pentest reports
- Show clear before/after comparisons
- Demonstrate attack effectiveness
- Make technical findings accessible to non-technical stakeholders

This exercise focuses on creating compelling visualizations for client reports.
Key techniques: perturbation analysis, attack landscape visualization, etc.

Example visualizations to implement:
1. Side-by-side original vs adversarial images
2. Perturbation heatmaps (show which pixels changed most)
3. Confidence score degradation graphs
4. Attack success rate by class/dataset
5. Perturbation magnitude histograms
6. Decision boundary visualization (if applicable)
