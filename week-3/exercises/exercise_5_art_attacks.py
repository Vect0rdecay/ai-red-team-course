Objective: Learn to use Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) for attacks

Red Team Context: Using established libraries speeds up testing in engagements.

Note: Requires 'adversarial-robustness-toolbox' package
Install: pip install adversarial-robustness-toolbox

This exercise demonstrates using ART's pre-built attacks:
- Membership inference attacks
- Evasion attacks  
- Model extraction attacks
