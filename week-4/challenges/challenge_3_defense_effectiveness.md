# Challenge 3: Defense Effectiveness Report

**Time Estimate**: 2 hours  
**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Deliverable**: `week-4/defense_comparison.md`

## Objective

Test multiple defense strategies against poisoning and backdoor attacks. Compare their effectiveness, cost, and deployment complexity. This builds understanding of defense trade-offs.

## Defense Strategies to Test

### Defense 1: Model Pruning
**Concept**: Remove neurons/connections that may contain backdoors
**Implementation**: Use pruning to reduce model complexity
**Expected**: Reduce backdoor effectiveness

### Defense 2: Adversarial Training
**Concept**: Train model to be robust against adversarial inputs
**Implementation**: Include adversarial samples in training
**Expected**: Improve general robustness

### Defense 3: Input Sanitization
**Concept**: Preprocess inputs to remove potential triggers
**Concept**: Apply filtering, normalization, validation
**Expected**: Remove or neutralize backdoor triggers

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Create Vulnerable Model (20 min)

**Task**: Train model with known backdoor
- Train model with backdoor trigger (from Challenge 2)
- Document backdoor activation rate
- This is your "vulnerable baseline"

### Phase 2: Implement Defenses (60 min)

**Task**: Apply each defense strategy

**For Each Defense**:
1. Implement defense technique
2. Apply to model (retrain or post-process)
3. Test against:
   - Clean samples (should still work)
   - Backdoor triggers (should be mitigated)
   - Adversarial samples (bonus: robustness test)

### Phase 3: Measure Effectiveness (30 min)

**Task**: Compare defense performance

**Metrics**:
- Backdoor mitigation rate
- Clean accuracy (maintained?)
- Computational cost
- Deployment complexity

### Phase 4: Analysis (10 min)

**Task**: Compare and recommend
