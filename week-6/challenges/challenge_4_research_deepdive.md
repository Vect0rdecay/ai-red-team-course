# Challenge 4: Research Paper Deep Dive

**Time Estimate**: 2 hours  
**Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Deliverable**: `week-6/research_implementation.md`

## Objective

Read a recent LLM security research paper, implement the technique, apply it to your target models, and document findings. This builds research-to-practice skills.

## Paper Selection

Choose from recent LLM security papers:
- AutoDAN (2024) - Automated jailbreak generation
- PAIR (2023) - Prompt automatic iterative refinement
- GCG (2023) - Greedy coordinate gradient attack
- Or other recent paper from your research

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Paper Reading (45 min)

**Task**: Read and understand paper

**Focus Areas**:
- Problem statement
- Methodology
- Implementation details
- Experimental results

### Phase 2: Implementation (60 min)

**Task**: Implement key technique

**Steps**:
1. Extract algorithm/methodology
2. Implement in code
3. Test on your models
4. Measure results

### Phase 3: Analysis (15 min)

**Task**: Compare with paper results

**Comparison**:
- Your results vs paper results
- Why differences? (if any)
- Insights from implementation
