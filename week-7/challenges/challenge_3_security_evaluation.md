- LLM attacks from Weeks 5-6 (if applicable)

**Metrics to Measure**:
- Adversarial accuracy
- Clean accuracy
- Attack success rate
- Robustness score

   - Adversarial test set (attack samples)
   - Edge cases (unusual inputs)
   - Real-world scenarios

2. **Attack Categories**:
   - Evasion attacks (FGSM, PGD, etc.)
   - Poisoning attacks
   - Backdoor triggers
   - LLM attacks (if applicable)

3. **Metrics**:
   - Accuracy metrics (clean, adversarial)
   - Robustness metrics
   - Performance metrics
   - Security posture score

4. **Evaluation Protocol**:
   - Test procedure
   - Measurement methodology
   - Reporting format

**Deliverable**: Evaluation framework document

### Phase 2: Baseline Measurement (30 min)

**Task**: Measure baseline model security posture

**Tests**:
1. Clean accuracy on test set
2. Attack success rates (all attack types)
3. Robustness baseline
4. Performance baseline

**Record Results**:
- Baseline metrics
- Attack effectiveness
- Vulnerability profile

### Phase 3: Defended Model Evaluation (60 min)

**Task**: Evaluate defended model(s) using framework

**For Each Defense**:

1. **Run Test Suite**:

   - Adversarial accuracy (each attack type)
   - Edge case handling
   - Performance overhead

2. **Calculate Metrics**:
   - Robustness improvement
   - Accuracy trade-off
   - Overall security score

3. **Compare to Baseline**:
   - Improvement percentage
   - Remaining vulnerabilities
   - Cost-benefit analysis

---

### Phase 4: Security Posture Assessment (30 min)

**Task**: Assess overall security posture

**Assessment Areas**:

1. **Robustness**:
   - How resistant to attacks?
   - Coverage across attack types
   - Remaining vulnerabilities

2. **Performance**:
   - Accuracy on clean data
   - Inference time
   - Resource requirements

3. **Practicality**:
   - Deployment feasibility
   - Maintenance requirements
   - Cost considerations

4. **Overall Posture**:
   - Security rating (e.g., High/Medium/Low)
   - Production readiness
   - Recommendations
